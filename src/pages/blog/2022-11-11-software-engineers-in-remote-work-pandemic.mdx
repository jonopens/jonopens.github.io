Oh, hey look! Another "how the pandemic changed my life post"! That's definitely unique and interesting, right? It's certainly true that this topic has been discussed to death, the proverbial dead horse flogged to nigh irrecognition, but for me, this post has mouldered for 15 months as I struggled to understand all the things that had changed in my life as a dev, my life as a husband, a member of a family, and now, as a father.

For me, the pandemic has been the single largest period of upheaval in my life, condensed into the shortest period of time and crystalized into something bizarre and stunning. Locked down, changed jobs twice, had a child, and that's not even everything. Wild madness nestled closely with absolute joy - it's enough to make your head spin, and I've found myself pondering what it all has meant, trying to play the distant observer to digest it fully. The result is a breakdown of how things are irreparably altered and how that's not such a bad thing.

## On Working in Your Home

Now that we're more or less looking at COVID in the rearview (I mean I still wear my mask and get my boosters and all that jazz, but the worst seems over), it feels somewhat self-evident that making the place where you work and the place where you live precisely the same is a dangerous proposition. I'll elaborate on what I mean by dangerous.

It was always easy for me to work from home in short bursts, and I've been fortunate that many of my jobs, in both software engineering and SEO have been supportive of at least partial remote work. But as you may suspect or be familiar with yourself, doing it every single day for months, years - **long-term working from home starts to feel like an invasion**. Your work life and your home life start to mix and blur. Covering something at home for your partner feels fine as long as you pay that time back, and perhaps because of some unwarranted guilt, you pay it back with interest. I certainly did, especially when my son was brand new. My stress levels, already juicing wildly as a new parent in lockdown, spiked even further.

The lesson that it has taken me an unsupportable amount of time to discover is simple and unremarkable: **to be successfull as a fulltime remote worker with other responsibilities, you have to draw boundaries and separate the two worlds**. It wouldn't be a lie to say that the previous assertion applies to basically any two things you intend to engage in that have a potential to overlap or compete with one another, but work and home constitute basically our entire lives. Letting the two blend too deeply ended with me feeling like I didn't know where one ended and the other began.

It's been nearly three years since this all started, and I'm just starting to solidify my own needs and rules. Make a contract with yourself and your family/roommates. It helps tremendously.

Of course, there's always a caveat...**some bleeding over is inevitable and, I dare say, valuable**. I wouldn't go so far as to say healthy, but consider this: working at home, I've been around to be a more present parent and partner. I've been able to see my son grow and create a bond that I cherish. Without COVID and the lockdown, my life at home would suffer across the board. 

To summarize, it's no exaggeration to say that I really lost sight of myself for a long while as work and home life competed for the same hours, but I've started to feel like I'm getting the hang of it.

## On Isolation, Motivation and Loneliness

Another thing that surprised me during lockdown was how my motivation dwindled over time.

I've often thought of myself as squarely introverted, and to some degree, it's a fact, but without having others around, it's tough to create that bond
