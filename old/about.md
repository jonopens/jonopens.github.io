So I'm Jon. I'm a **software engineer**. I work at **MikMak** across the stack. I used to work at Pager and CARFAX, mostly doing frontend. After years of tinkering with Bash scripts and Python for search-related projects, I decided to pivot to software engineering in 2017. I applied to the Immersive Web Development program at Flatiron School and was accepted. I graduated at the end of 2017.

I'm a **father** of one. My son Benjamin amazes me at every turn.

I'm a **husband**. My wife Jaime is the thoughtful partner that I've always wanted and pushes me to be better every single day (like I've always needed).

I’m an **SEO** with over 14 years of experience. I’ve managed the SEO programs at 1stdibs.com and XO Group, Inc. (formerly The Knot). My specialties are technical and content SEO, especially for early growth stage companies. In recent years, I've been more curious about **PURPOSEFUL SEO**, so if you work for a non-profit, particularly those that work in environmental preservation, wildlife preservation, green spaces, recycling or anything eco-friendly, don't hesitate to reach out. Please email "me AT jonopens.com" if you have a project you'd like to discuss.

I'm a bad whittler, a guitar player, rock climber, runner, video gamer and all sorts of other things. Nice to meet ya!
