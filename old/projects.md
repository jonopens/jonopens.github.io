## Disco Floor

A fun project I started in December of 2018. React SPA with MobX for state management. Goal was to make an app that would allow a user to program in tiles and have them persist locally.

##  Purposeful SEO

My Module 5 project at Flatiron School's web immersive program. React and Redux on the frontend with a Rails backend. The goal of this project was to create a way to more easily share beginner's SEO insights with those lacking skills or experience in Search Engine Optimization. Ultimately, it felt like a failure because it was shallow. It's currently undergoing a reimagination and rewrite.
