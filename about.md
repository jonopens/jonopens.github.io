So I'm Jon. I'm a developer. I work at CARFAX.

I’m an SEO with over 10 years of experience. I’ve managed the SEO programs at XO Group, Inc. (formerly The Knot) and 1stdibs.com. My specialties are strategic SEO, particularly technical and content SEO, for startups and early growth stage companies. Please email jon < @ > jonopens.com if you want to talk.

After years of tinkering with Bash scripts and Python, I decided to pivot to software engineering in 2017. I applied to the Immersive Web Development program at Flatiron School and was accepted. I graduated at the end of 2017.

In my spare time, I like to play guitar (poorly), rock climb, run, play video games and all sorts of other things. Nice to meet ya!
